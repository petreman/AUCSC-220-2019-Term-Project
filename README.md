# Software Engineering I 2019 Term Project: Pigs In a Pen
A simple Android game made in Android Studio by two other team members and I. Similar to the games "[Dots and Boxes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dots_and_Boxes)", but with a pig theme: "Lines" represent pens and "boxes" represent pens for pigs. The player takes turns against an AI or other human player, trying to enclose pigs of in pens. Whoever ends the game with the most points wins.

## Features:
- Single player (vs computer player) and local multiplayer (vs another person o nthe same device)
- Multiple gameboard sizes
- Simplified UI with a single screen for all games, with a hamburger menu to view other options
- Instant swapping between computer and multiplayer games
- High score tracking with gameboard specific leaderboards

## Project Components

1. [Project Design Document](https://ualbertaca-my.sharepoint.com/:w:/g/personal/petreman_ualberta_ca/Eauz9nBTYTlGiRkrfQmCU40Bi1rED3KdrFAoD1-5n8yHVQ?e=Oq6Gaa)
   
   Created prior to any implementation, it contains an overall description of the project, as well as the requirements specification, functional requirements, early design wireframes, UML diagrams representing the low-level implementation, and a summary of each team meeting up to the deadline of the document.

2. [Design Decisions Presentation](https://ualbertaca-my.sharepoint.com/:p:/g/personal/gihozo_ualberta_ca/EepaeDciuatOmEf0xx6IlawBrAdK429j_dzeuvQyPyjY2g?e=7JA5iF)

   This was done to get feedback from other classmates as well as from the instructor to ensure we were on the right track before beginning implementation.
   
3. [Implementation Document](https://ualbertaca-my.sharepoint.com/:w:/g/personal/petreman_ualberta_ca/EbykNdTxSYVGpuuw4cOxf40BkSdVpoWNGmf04n2AH7doxg?e=xfCHS5)

   After beginning the prototype implementation, we were tasked with creating a follow-up document to the design document, discussing the changes we had made, showcasing the initial work we had done with code samples and UI screenshots, and what bugs we were aware of.
  
4. [MVP Presentation](https://ualbertaca-my.sharepoint.com/:p:/g/personal/gihozo_ualberta_ca/EU0xju5zmntBlHSRswCLywEBExkZ7y0qLwkoR2I6qd8FJg?e=Hv4083) 

   We shared some of our implementation details with the class, as well as showcased a working prototype. After all other groups had presented, everyone in the class had to vote for which team's game they liked the best: we got second place (out of 8 teams).
   
5. [Final Product Document](https://ualbertaca-my.sharepoint.com/:w:/g/personal/petreman_ualberta_ca/EYqAOKsVOKBLjjYcUBCJ68oBqhhBZwEyski3KwSkSJb0ig?e=dsMfj6)

   This was presented to the instructor on the last day of class and prior to demonstration of our final version (which is the version on master).
